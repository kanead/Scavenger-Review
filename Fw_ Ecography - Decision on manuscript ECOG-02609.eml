Hi all,

Our paper has been rejected by Ecography. Not entirely negative comments ho=
wever. The main criticisms seem to be directed towards the structure and th=
e novelty of some portions. Reviewer 3 in particular has drawn up a compreh=
ensive list of useful suggestions. I'll get back on this asap.=20

Dear Dr. Kane:

I write to you regarding manuscript # ECOG-02609 entitled "A Recipe for Sca=
venging - the natural history of a behaviour" which you have submitted to E=
cography.

In view of the criticisms of the reviewer(s) and the recommendation by the =
Subject Editor, found at the bottom of this letter, your manuscript has bee=
n rejected by Ecography. However, you are welcome to submit a thoroughly re=
vised version of your manuscript. If you decide to resubmit, please include=
 a detailed account of how you handled the editor and reviewers comments. N=
otice that the resubmitted manuscript will be treated as a new submission a=
nd may be evaluated by external reviewers.

Thank you for considering Ecography.

Sincerely,

Prof. Miguel Ara=FAjo
Editor-in-Chief, Ecography



Recommendation by the Subject Editor (anonymous):
Three experienced reviews have evaluated your manuscript. Two of them are e=
xtremely critical of several aspects related to to the general handcraft an=
d novelly of the review. The third reviewer is more positive, while making =
substantial recommendations for improvement of the manuscript. Should you b=
e able to address all of the reviewers comments in a much revised version o=
f the manuscript I would happy to reconsider the manuscript for considerati=
on in Ecography and the E4 Award. This is not a provisional acceptance, sin=
ce the manuscript would need to be revised again.

itten, and most (but not all) pertinent literature sources are included.  I=
 do worry about the lack of novelty of the manuscript, and what I perceived=
 as haphazard organization.  Here are some specific issues that should be a=
ddressed in my opinion:

1.      Abstract:  Scavenging can be difficult to observe, but probably no =
more so than predation.  Also, using experimental carcasses, scavenging is =
actually quite easy to observe.
2.      Abstract:  You should point out that your =91scale of scavenging=92=
 is only qualitative; you made no attempt to quantify such traits.
3.      Introduction:  Much of this section seems to follow DeVault=92s (20=
03) review paper on scavenging=97in fact, there is almost nothing new here =
that is not covered in that earlier review.
4.      Introduction:  You mention that you will use =93other methods in or=
der to discern the most suitable morphologies=85=94  but you don=92t say wh=
at they are.  What other methods are you talking about?
5.      I think that early on in the paper you need to define obligate and =
facultative scavengers and then throughout the paper, specify which you are=
 referring to.  For example, in the first sentence of the Detection section=
, you talk about =91known scavengers=92, but it is unclear if you really me=
an obligate scavengers.  Nearly all carnivorous vertebrates are scavengers =
at least to some extent, so you need to elaborate on what you mean when you=
 talk about =91scavengers=92.
6.      Last sentence of Introduction:  Again, you propose a =91scale of sc=
avenging=92, but without quantification, it is unclear how useful this =91s=
cale=92 is.
7.      Page 6, 12:  In your discussion of aquatic scavengers, you might wa=
nt to refer to Beasley et al. (2012; Oikos 121:1021-1026).
8.      Page 6:  Why is jaw morphology likely to define scavengers?  Please=
 elaborate.
9.      Page 9:  It is true that carrion can comprise a large percentage of=
 a hyena=92s diet, but your text seems misleading.  Most studies have shown=
 that most of a hyena=92s diet is from predation.  For example, see Cooper =
et al. (1999; Afr. J. Ecol. 37:149=96160) and Gasaway et al. (1991; Afr. J.=
 Ecol. 29: 64=9675).
10.     Your section on Handling Time is so short that I think it should be=
 cut or combined with another section.

Comments to the Author
This article is a review of the literature what the authors term a "natural=
 history" of scavenging. They have approached the topic from the perspectiv=
e of ecological variables (and other variables that condition them) in opti=
mal foraging theory including encounter rate and handling time, but also me=
tabolism, locomotion (e.g soaring and swimming), detection, prey availabili=
ty, competition, and food processing. They describe many useful examples of=
 the behavior and ecology of obligate and facultative scavengers. But I thi=
nk they often go to far in their assumptions in trying to weave these examp=
les together in a synthetic way. Some examples are inferring scrounging beh=
aviors in flying pterosaurs (pace 11), assuming that hominins used vultures=
 to identify scavenging opportunities (page 11), surmising that scavenging =
evolved with the earliest tetrapods based on "potential carrion unexploited=
 by marine vertebrates" (page 12). There is a lot of "these researchers hav=
e suggested X" and then taking that as a given fact.

While the authors distinguish between obligate and facultative scavenging, =
they tend to lump them together when it comes to constructing their argumen=
ts. In the end, is the argument about the former, or the latter? Is the rea=
l interest in whether species scavenge at all, what proportion of their res=
ources are obtained by scavenging, or what the conditions are that produce =
facultative or obligate scavengers? They also seem to ignore flexibility in=
 species' behaviors. For instance, while spotted hyenas are on their highly=
 scavenging side of their Figures 1 and 2, in some ecosystems they hunt sig=
nificant proportion of their prey. Similarly, lions can take a large propor=
tion of their prey as scavenged, as the authors note. But to suggest, as th=
ey do in their abstract, that they can apply their scale of scavenging to a=
ny species at any time to judge how important scavenging was in its diet is=
 frankly completely ignoring behavioral variability over time and space. It=
 is substantially more difficult with fossil species for which we may know =
far fewer of the variables they list in Figure 1, in a nuanced way. Figure =
2 does not display the diversity of scavengers through time, it displays ex=
amples of species that display observed or inferred scavenging behaviors. D=
iversity has specific ecological definition(s) that are being ignored here.

If the authors chose to resubmit, I would suggest they organize their manus=
cript based on known information about modern species, known (e.g. bone pro=
cessing by theropods) and inferred (e.g. scavenging in hominins) informatio=
n about fossil species, and then try to draw broader conclusions. They migh=
t look to articles about other modern scavenging opportunities such as Capa=
ldo and Peter's study of wildebeest drownings http://www.sciencedirect.com/=
science/article/pii/S0305440385700398, and suggestions that sabertooth cats=
 which they claim were unable to feed on bones may have consumed more bone =
than penecontemporaneous dire wolves https://www.jstor.org/stable/20627167?=
seq=3D1#page_scan_tab_contents.

In sum, while I think the aim of the article is a very worthwhile one, I th=
ink the authors cannot claim to have produced an all-encompassing model tha=
t can predict the presence or level of scavenging in any organism - because=
 I think this simply cannot be done.

Finally, some of the perspectives of this manuscript overlap substantially =
with parts of Beasley et al. 2015 (pages 108-112), which is cited numerous =
times in the manuscript.

Comments to the Author
This is a well-written, enjoyable manuscript that assesses the functional t=
raits associated to past and, mostly, current major vertebrate scavengers. =
As a result, the authors provide a sort of guide to identify the extent of =
scavenging behaviour among carnivores in both current and past ecosystems. =
I have several suggestions that should be considered before publication (pl=
ease see below).

Major comments:

1. Invertebrates are ignored completely throughout the ms. Please specify i=
n the Introduction that this review focuses on vertebrate scavengers. In th=
is line, I recommend to include =93in vertebrates=94 at the end of the titl=
e to be more specific. Also, in the =93Competition=94 section you mention c=
ompetition with vertebrates and micro-organisms, but not with invertebrates=
. You should consider them in this section (and in =93Facilitation=94; see =
next point).

2. I found difficult to follow the main point of the paper because the ms i=
s not well organized. Following a hierarchical order, I=92d define four/fiv=
e main sections: =93Introduction=94, =93The Challenges of Scavenging=94 (th=
is could be a subsection within the previous section), =93Encounter Rate=94=
 (with four different subsections: =93Metabolism=94, =93Locomotion=94, =93S=
ensory Detection=94 and =93Carcass Availability=94), =93Handling Time=94 (w=
hich would include =93Food Processing=94) and =93Conclusion=94. Moreover, =
=93Competition=94 and =93Facilitation=94 (I strongly encourage you to consi=
der not only competitive, but also facilitative processes, which are mostly=
 neglected in your review) should be treated as transversal factors that ca=
n modulate each of the abovementioned parameters. Thus, I=92d include them =
in a different section, or mention the competitive and facilitative process=
es related to each parameter within each subsection. Fig. 1 should be re-or=
ganized accordingly.

3. The use of the scientific literature on scavenging is deficient, especia=
lly for a review paper like this. A number of key references are missing, e=
.g., Selva & Fortuna (2007 Proc. R Soc. B 274:1101-1108), Wilson & Wolkovic=
h (2011 TREE 23:129-135), Beasley et al. (2012 Oikos 121:1021-1026), Cort=
=E9s-Avizanda et al. (2012 Ecology 93:2570-2579), Cort=E9s-Avizanda et al. =
(2014 Ecology 95:1799-1808), Mole=F3n et al. (2014 Biol. Rev. 89:1042-1054)=
, Pereira et al. (2014 Mammal Rev. 44:44-55), P=E9riquet et al. (2015 Biol.=
 Rev. 90:1197-1214), Mateo-Tom=E1s et al. (2015 Divers. Distrib. 21:913-924=
), Mole=F3n & S=E1nchez-Zapata (2015 BioScience 65:1003-1010), Moreno-Opo e=
t al. (2016 Behav. Ecol.), Sebasti=E1n-Gonz=E1lez et al. (2016 Ecology 97:9=
5-105). Your literature synthesis might benefit from the reading of these a=
rticles, for instance regarding competitive and facilitative interactions a=
mong scavengers. Also, the review would be more informative and useful for =
readers. Next I mention some particular comments regarding the use of the r=
eferences (I mention others in Minor comments):
Page 2, 1st sentence: but see Mole=F3n & S=E1nchez-Zapata (2015); many of t=
he most charismatic vertebrates of the world are scavengers. Rather than =
=93scavengers=94, what is not charismatic is probably =93scavenging=94.
Page 2, 13th line: Mole=F3n & S=E1nchez-Zapata (2015) may be more appropria=
te than Koenig (2006) because the former is more general and not restricted=
 to vultures.
Page 2, lines 17th-18th: see Pereira et al. (2014) and P=E9riquet et al. (2=
015) for reviews.
Page 3, bottom paragraph, bottom line: this is not true, as scavenging may =
indirectly affect herbivore populations and thus carrion availability (see =
Mole=F3n et al. 2014 Biol. Rev.).
Page 5, bottom paragraph, 1st sentence: Mateo-Tom=E1s et al. (2015) is more=
 general than Kendall (2013).
Page 8, 1st and 2nd sentences: see Pereira et al. (2014) and P=E9riquet et =
al. (2015).
Page 8, 3rd sentence: you may also cite DeVault et al. (2003) and Pereira e=
t al. (2014).
Page 8, 8th-17th lines: please reword; wild dogs hardly scavenge, while leo=
pards and lions are frequent scavengers (see Pereira et al. 2014).
Page 11, 1st sentence: see Kane et al. (2014) and Mole=F3n et al. (2014 Bio=
l. Rev.) for inter-specific interactions.
Page 11, 4th sentence: Kane et al. (2014) is not appropriate here because i=
t is about inter-specific interactions; use Cort=E9s-Avizanda et al. (2014)=
 instead.
Page 14, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence: see also Mole=F3n et al. (2014 Biol. =
Rev.) and Pereira et al. (2014).
Page 14, 2nd paragraph, 2nd sentence: see better Pereira et al. (2014) and =
P=E9riquet et al. (2015).
Page 14, bottom paragraph, 3rd sentence: you may also consider Moreno-Opo e=
t al. (2016).
Page 15, 2nd paragraph, 2nd sentence: see also Mole=F3n et al. (2014 Biol. =
Rev.) and Pereira et al. (2014).

4. You should include more discussion about the importance of carcass size =
throughout the ms, as it has a strong influence on scavenging patterns and =
interactions among vertebrates and between vertebrates and smaller carrion =
consumers (e.g., see Mole=F3n et al. 2015).

Minor comments:

GENERAL

1. Please provide line numbers to facilitate the reviewing process.

ABSTRACT

2. You could remove =93, the first to our knowledge=94.

3. Also, you could mention some relevant specific findings of your synthesi=
s.

THE CHALLENGES OF SCAVENGING

4. Page 3, 1st sentence: =93often difficult to predict=94 compared to what?=
 Please specify. There are many examples in which carrion is highly predict=
able, e.g., during salmon spawning (see also Pereira et al. 2014).

ENCOUNTER RATE

5. Page 3, bottom paragraph, 3rd line: change =93Alternatively=94 to =93Als=
o=94?

METABOLISM

6. Page 4, 1st sentence: =93the sporadic nature of carrion=94; please expla=
in.

LOCOMOTION

7. Page 4, bottom paragraph, 1st sentence: change =93inherent=94 to =93rela=
tive=94.

8. Page 4, bottom paragraph, 3rd sentence: remove =93, paradoxically,=94.

9. Page 5, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence: change =93appear=94 to =93appeared=
=94. Also, specify Mya for the Cretaceous period.

10. Page 9, top paragraph: please be more cautious in your assertion, as co=
operation skills and tools of early hominins probably allowed them to defen=
d and usurp carcasses from more powerful scavengers.

DETECTION

11. Page 11, top and 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence: this is about facilitatio=
n. As said above, facilitative processes may affect other parameters as wel=
l, not only the ability to detect carrion.

12. Page 11, last sentence: explain why wind speed affects the olfactory ca=
pacity of an aquatic species.

PREY AVAILABILITY

13. I=92d change this title to =93Carcass Availability=94, which is more sp=
ecific.

14. Among the different components of carcass availability, e.g., abundance=
, duration, predictability and accessibility, in this section you only talk=
 about abundance and duration. You should also discuss about carcass predic=
tability (e.g., see Cort=E9s-Avizanda et al. 2012) and carcass accessibilit=
y (e.g., see DeVault & Krochmal 2002).

15. Page 12, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence: as said before, this is not true,=
 given that scavenging may indirectly affect herbivore populations and thus=
 carrion availability (see Mole=F3n et al. 2014 Biol. Rev.).

16. Page 13, 3rd and 4th sentences: whaling has exerted also a huge negativ=
e impact on scavengers by depleting whale populations. If you are going to =
talk about human impacts, maybe is better to do it at the end of the ms, pe=
rhaps in a new section in which you explore which scavenging traits could b=
e more successful in a human dominated world.

17. You should also take into account facilitative processes. For instance,=
 some scavengers are able to access the interior of carcasses only once oth=
er, more powerful species, has opened the skin (see Mole=F3n et al. 2014 Bi=
ol. Rev.).

18. Page 14, bottom paragraph, 2nd sentence: I=92d change it to =93This is =
true for many vultures and other major avian scavengers such as albatrosses=
 who all have [=85]=94.

FOOD PROCESSING

19. Page 16, 2nd paragraph, 6th sentence: insert =93Within mammals,=94 befo=
re =93This ability=94.

20. Page 17, 2nd paragraph, 4th sentence: do you refer to species or indivi=
duals? Higher species diversity doesn=92t mean more individuals.

21. Page 18, 1st sentence: change =93enabling=94 to =93enable=94.

22. Page 18, 3rd sentence: =93thus=94? I don=92t understand this sentence; =
could you please reword it?

23. Page 18, 5th sentence: =93The mix of strong and weak features in their =
skull morphology=94; please explain it.

CONCLUSION

24. Page 18, bottom paragraph, 3rd sentence: change =93technique=94 to =93a=
pproach=94?

FIGURES

25. Fig. 2: you may insert the name and Mya range of each period in the X a=
xis rather than in the figure legend. Also, I=92d indicate =93aerial=94, =
=93terrestrial=94 and =93aquatic=94 in the Y axis rather than in the legend=
.


Hope this helps,
Marcos Mole=F3n
